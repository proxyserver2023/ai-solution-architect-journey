Here are several hands-on project ideas—ranging from medium to high complexity—that will get you comfortable defining and orchestrating MCP tools in real-world scenarios:

---

## 1. **“Smart” Travel Planner**

Build an agent that, given a user’s trip dates and destination, will:

1. **Fetch flight options** via a “flightSearch” tool (inputs: origin, dest, dates).
2. **Check weather** at destination via a “weather” tool.
3. **Reserve hotels** via a “hotelBooking” tool.
4. **Compose a trip summary** with links and an itinerary.

**Why it’s complex:**

* Chaining multiple external APIs
* Handling errors/fallbacks (e.g. no flights found)
* Prompting user for clarifications (budget, preferences)

---

## 2. **Interactive Code Assistant**

Expose two tools:

* **“runCode”**: executes snippets in a sandbox (inputs: code, language)
* **“explainError”**: takes an error message and returns human-readable guidance

Then build a QA agent that:

1. Receives buggy code.
2. Calls **runCode**, sees errors.
3. Calls **explainError** to diagnose.
4. Proposes fixes and re-runs until success.

**Why it’s complex:**

* Looping/tool-in-tool calls until a stop condition
* Managing tool state (last error, retries)

---

## 3. **Personal Finance Dashboard**

Define tools like:

* **“getBalance”** (bank account ID)
* **“getTransactions”** (account, date range)
* **“currencyConvert”** (amount, from, to)

Then build an assistant that can answer questions like:

> “Show me my total spending last month in USD, grouped by category.”

You’ll need to:

* Aggregate and transform data in-prompt
* Handle pagination/date windows
* Format tables or charts (via a “drawChart” tool)

---

## 4. **On-Call Incident Responder**

Tools:

* **“createTicket”** (title, body, priority)
* **“getPagerDutyStatus”** (service ID)
* **“escalateAlert”** (alert ID, level)

Flow:

1. User reports “Service X is down.”
2. Agent confirms severity (`getPagerDutyStatus`).
3. If critical, `createTicket` + `escalateAlert`.
4. Summarize actions back to user.

**Why it’s complex:**

* Conditional logic based on tool output
* Multi-step stateful conversation

---

## 5. **Knowledge Base with RAG**

* **“searchDocs”**: vector‐search in your docs repo
* **“fetchDoc”**: retrieve raw text by ID

Agent should answer domain-specific questions by:

1. Running `searchDocs` to get top 3 hits.
2. Pulling full content via `fetchDoc`.
3. Generating a concise answer with citations.

**Why it’s complex:**

* Orchestrating search + retrieval + generation
* Formatting citations and handling missing docs

---

## 6. **Home Automation Orchestrator**

Tools:

* **“turnOnLight”**, **“setThermostat”**, **“lockDoor”**, **“getSensorData”**

User: “I’m leaving for vacation.”
Agent:

1. Checks all doors locked via `getSensorData`.
2. If any unlocked, issues `lockDoor`.
3. Sets thermostat to away mode.
4. Confirms with user.

**Why it’s complex:**

* Real-time sensor checks
* Multiple side-effecting calls
* Idempotency and error handling

---

## 7. **Calendar Scheduler with Availability**

Tools:

* **“getEvents”** (calendar ID, date range)
* **“createEvent”** (calendar ID, time, title)

User: “Find me a 1-hour slot next week for a team sync.”
Agent:

1. Fetches existing events via `getEvents`.
2. Computes free slots in prompt or via helper tool.
3. Proposes times, asks user to pick.
4. Calls `createEvent`.

**Why it’s complex:**

* Date/time arithmetic in-prompt (or via mini “findFreeSlot” tool)
* Multi-turn clarification

---

### 🛠️ Tips for Building & Testing

* **Mock your tools** first (return canned JSON) to focus on prompt logic.
* Write **unit tests** that simulate tool outputs and verify your agent’s decisions.
* Start **simple**, then layer in branching logic (if/then).
* Use schemas (e.g. Zod) to validate tool inputs/outputs inside your `execute` functions.

By tackling one of these end-to-end projects, you’ll get deep practice on:

* Designing tool interfaces & schemas
* Crafting robust prompts for orchestration
* Handling errors, retries, and user clarifications
* Building real‐world MCP-powered assistants
