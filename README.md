## MCP Use Cases

### Resource Templates

#### Dynamic Data
```
"users://{userId}" -> User profiles
"products://{sku}" -> Product information
```

> User: "Can you tell me about user 12345?"
> AI Assistant: "Looking up user 12345... They joined in 2023 and have made 50 purchases."

#### Generate Content On-Demand
```
"reports://{year}/{month}" -> Monthly reports
"analytics://{dateRange}" -> Custom analytics
```

> User: "Show me the report for March 2024"
> AI Assistant: "Accessing March 2024 report... Revenue was up 15% compared to February."

#### Parameter-Based Resources
```
"search://{query}" -> Search results
"filter://{type}/{value}" -> Filtered data
```

> User: "Find all transactions above $1000"
> AI Assistant: "Using the filter resource... Found 23 transactions matching your criteria."


### MCP Tools

#### File Operations

```
name: "write-file"
arguments: {
  path: "/logs/report.txt",
  content: "Daily summary..."
}
```

> User: Save this report to a file”

> AI: I’ll use the write-file tool… File has been saved successfully.

API Interactions
```
name: "fetch-weather"
arguments: {
  location: "San Francisco",
  units: "celsius"
}
```

> User: What’s the weather in San Francisco?

> AI: Let me check… According to the weather API, it’s 18°C and sunny.

Data Processing

```
name: "analyze-data"
arguments: {
  dataset: "sales_2024_q1",
  operation: "summary_stats"
}
```

> User: Calculate the summary statistics for Q1 sales

> AI: Running analysis… Average sale was 342, median 342, …
